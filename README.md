## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS custom properties, especially their use outside of the `:root` rule set. It was a useful opportunity to experiment with using custom properties and scope.

It was also great to tackle a grid layout with some tricky elements. Thinking this through before setting the styles was super useful.

### Continued development

There's definitely a lot more to explore with CSS Grid. I'd like to work on projects with more complex layouts to get more of a grasp of its functionality - in particular how it can make responsive design simpler and the codebase less verbose.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's "Responsive Layout Practice"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFbxl_VmIx0) - This walkthrough of two solutions to the same challenge was helpful to watch having finished a first draft to see the different approaches to the layout using Flexbox and Grid.
